    <title>Review Mozilla: What is accessibility?</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>In the "Review Mozilla: What is accessibility?" task, I dived into the fundamental concept of web accessibility. This activity gave me a deep understanding of what web accessibility is all about and why it matters. I learned that web accessibility is all about making websites and online content usable for people with disabilities, like those who are visually or hearing impaired. The resources from Mozilla emphasized the importance of following accessibility guidelines and best practices to create a web that's welcoming to all users. This understanding has reinforced my commitment to considering accessibility in every web project I work on. I want to make sure my websites are user-friendly for everyone, regardless of their abilities.</p>

    <h1>Welcome to Your Website</h1>
    <p>In the "Use the W3C Markup Validation Service" task, I put the W3C Markup Validation Service to work. It helped me identify and fix HTML errors in a web page, ensuring that it meets HTML standards. This process taught me how to create cleaner, error-free code, which is essential not only for web accessibility but also for making sure web pages work well on different browsers and devices. I see this as a valuable step in my web development workflow, and I plan to use it regularly to maintain well-structured and accessible web content.</p>
