    <p>For Windows, I began by exploring Microsoft's resources, diving into "How do I fix network adapter problems?" and "Change TCP/IP Settings." These guides provided invaluable insights into configuring my network settings. I also utilized 'ipconfig' to display a wealth of IP address information and practiced the release and renewal of dynamic IP addresses.

For macOS, I turned to Apple's 'Network Utility' to examine my network settings, and MacWorld's guidance helped me configure network settings through 'System Preferences / Network.' I delved into advanced options and TCP/IP settings for DHCP lease renewal.

In the realm of Linux, YoLinux offered a range of Network GUI Configuration Tools for me to review my network settings. I also employed 'ifconfig' as suggested by Wikipedia to gain a deeper understanding of my network configurations. Furthermore, CyberCiti's guidance came in handy for forcefully releasing and renewing dynamic IP addresses using 'dhclient.'

This activity equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively manage and troubleshoot IP address settings on various operating systems, enhancing my overall network proficiency.

    <p> I took a systematic approach to check and troubleshoot any potential issues. Firstly, I inspected physical connections, looking out for those indicator lights in wired setups, and simply confirming through the user interface for wireless connections. Moving on, I delved into the specifics of IP address settings, using 'ipconfig' for Windows and various options like Network Utility, System Preferences / Network, or 'ifconfig' for macOS, as well as similar alternatives for Linux.

To test if everything was working as it should, I used the 'ping' command to check my local IP address, default gateway, and a well-known internet host like '8.8.8.8.' Additionally, I traced data routes using 'Tracert' and an online tool, and I verified name resolution with 'Nslookup.' These steps not only ensured my internet connection was up and running smoothly but also equipped me with valuable troubleshooting skills, ready to tackle any connectivity issues that might arise./p>
