        <p>As you might recall, I really enjoyed the session on CSS we did. It really opened my eyes to the power of front end development and what it has to offer. I also see it being a special career in the future as it is one that requires a special touch, It's subjectice to current consumer trends/interests and therefore cannot be done by A.I. I plan to create a website that uses all of the CSS elements I have learned in the CSS course, and have the website be a teaching tool that talks about the history of CSS, its comparison to XSL. I will also teach some of the basics that can be used to make your site more user firendly. I will then recoed a video talking about my site and some of the elements I used to build it and what they mean.</p>
