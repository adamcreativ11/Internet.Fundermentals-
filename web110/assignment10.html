  <h1>Assignment 10 summary</h1>
  <p>In this lesson, I learned a lot about CSS and its applications in web design. I found it particularly useful for enhancing the visual aspects of a website. As I applied what I learned, I was able to modify the appearance of web elements, including text, backgrounds, and borders. I also gained a better understanding of how to structure CSS rules with selectors and declaration blocks to achieve specific design goals.</p>
  <p>One key takeaway for me was the importance of CSS in achieving consistency and professionalism in web design. It allows for easy and efficient management of a website's layout and styling. I also grasped the concept of classes and IDs, where classes can be used for multiple elements, while IDs should be unique to a single element.</p>
  <p>Overall, this lesson provided valuable insights into the power and flexibility of CSS in web development, and I'm excited to continue applying these concepts to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages.</p>
