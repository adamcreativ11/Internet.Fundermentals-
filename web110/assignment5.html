    <title>Social Media</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>The TutorialsPoint activity gave me an introduction to the world of social networking. It explained that social networking is all about connecting people and organizations through various mediums to share thoughts, interests, and activities. I learned about different social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn, each with its unique features. For instance, I found Facebook interesting because it lets me share text, photos, videos, and even play online games. If I'm looking to connect with professionals and find job opportunities, LinkedIn seems like a great choice. Twitter, with its short and snappy tweets, caught my attention for quick communication. And when it comes to mobile-based messaging, I can't decide between WhatsApp, Line, and Hike; they all sound useful for sending messages, videos, and audio. Ultimately, the decision on which social media sites interest me the most depends on my specific communication needs, interests, and goals. It's all about finding the platforms that align with what I want to achieve in the world of social networking.

    <title>HoneyComb Mode</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>In this activity, we took a closer look at how well-known social media platforms align with the Honeycomb framework, which includes elements like identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. We found that Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter stand out as platforms that fully embrace the Honeycomb framework, offering a rich variety of features for users. Meanwhile, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, Tumblr, and YouTube also provide substantial support for these elements, albeit with different focuses on specific aspects. Each platform has its unique strengths, with Facebook fostering personal connections, LinkedIn nurturing professional networks, and Instagram concentrating on visual content sharing. Keep in mind that the ever-evolving nature of social media means that platform features may have evolved since our last update in September 2021, so it's a good idea to consult the latest sources for the most current information.p>
