Over the semester, I really dug into the world of web development and explored the ins and outs of the Internet, uncovering some seriously valuable insights. From getting the hang of HTML and CSS basics to realizing how crucial responsive design is, this journey has armed me with some seriously practical skills. Now, I can put these skills to work, creating websites that not only work like a charm but also look and feel great for users. And let me tell you, the whole process of putting together and sharing my final project on YouTube? It wasn't just a task on my to-do list â€“ it turned into a real opportunity to step up my game in how I talk about and show off my work. This semester I found my love  for CSS and front end development, therefore at the end of this course I can reflect on how I have done and say I have done my very best to succeed and will use what I have learned in my future.
