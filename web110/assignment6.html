    <p> I recently dived into some research on Intellectual Property matters, specifically honing in on the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the whole piracy scene, especially the peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing stuff. My main goal was to understand what RIAA thinks about all this piracy business, get into the legal nitty-gritty, and find out what could happen if someone's caught up in it. Basically, I wanted to break it down in a straightforward way for anyone curious about sharing stuff online and the potential consequences if you're not on the right side of the law.<p>
